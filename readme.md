# includeos-testrunner

WIP test runner prototype for running and viewing the results of all the [IncludeOS](http://www.includeos.org/) tests without manually having to faff around navigating through dozens of directories, looking for the right Makefiles, inspecting output, etc.

Currently only handles "old style" tests (Makefile + run.sh); being updated to handle "modern" tests (test.sh scripts with multiple IncludeOS images).

[Sample output](https://gist.github.com/ingve/fba43e147a56a076f904)

Requirements: Node.js 5.
